# Î¼GATO - Mini Unofficial GATO

A small, simple implementation of what's described in [DeepMind's GATO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06175).

Goals:

- Clarity
- Simplicity
- Iterability
- Experimentability

Non-goals:

- Runtime performance
- Eval performance

# GATO

The GATO paper only describes a way of tokenizing and sequencing data so that we can feed it into a sequence model. They use a transformer for the model. But the architecture isn't really the point of the paper.

Tokenizing and sequencing data is what the bulk of the paper is about.

Tokenizing and sequencing data is what the bulk of this repo is about.
